The burger was as great as I remembered it being back in 2001. Welcome to Boulder and keep up the great food!"

The staff is always friendly and the place is always clean.  Their menu is simple and easy to read, and the prices are straight forward.  Oh and if you buy the fries, get them CAJUN STYLE!"

I also love the ramen. The broth itself is so flavorful and doesn't contain any pork like most ramen places."
