Yomp is a full stack web application that takes inspiration from the popular website "yelp" with a focus on burger joints. Users can add burger joints as well as leave reviews with full CRUD functionality. 

## Installation instructions
Clone the repo and run the command "npm install" in both the /frontend and /backend folders.

This project was built using React/Redux for the frontend and NodeJS/Express for the backend.

Additional features to be implemented include search functionality and google maps integration.

This was my first full stack web application so it was a huge learning process, but I've gained a better understanding of not only the coding logic, but the steps and planning required to efficiently put together all the pieces.
